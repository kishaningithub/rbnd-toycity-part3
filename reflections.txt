How long did you spend working on this project?
- 4 Hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
- Respecting "commit". 
- Getting my head strait with syntax because i tend to
  mix up scala's syntax in ruby and vice versa because 
  im also learning scala in the mean time.

What two additional features did you build? Why?
- A way for customers to return items
  - Reason: It seemed intresting
- Better ways to find transactions
  - find_by_customer
  - find_by_customer_for_product
  - Reason: These were relevant to the previous task at hand
  
Where do you still have room to grow?
- I always feel there is an ocean to learn. So yes there
  is space everywhere. "Space the final frontier :-)"
